# React Task for Devfolio Internship

## Problem Statement
1. Build a multi-column sortable list of tags similar to the one seen on [Devfolio](https://devfolio.co/profile/experience) using React. The implementation should be without the use of any prebuilt component such as React Beautiful DND / React Sortable HOC. Refer the below image.

2.Create an autocomplete input that displays suggestions via the [Stack Exchange Tags API](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/tags). You may use a prebuilt React component for this (for e.g., react-select).

3. Save user-selected tags with respective priorities to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) or any service of your choice. User authentication is not required here.
4. Host a demo on [](https://surge.sh/)[Now](https://now.sh/) or any [other](https://netlify.com/) platform.
